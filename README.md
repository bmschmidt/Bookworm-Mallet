Bookworm-Mallet
===============

Bookworm Mallet integration

This is a stub repo as a template for a Bookworm extension.

This particular extensions replaces a Bookworm's "master_bookcounts" file with one that includes a `topic` column,
created by MALLET. All the necessary work will happen on running `make database` in the directory; some dependencies are not automatically installed
